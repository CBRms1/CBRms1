# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my Github profile.

### How am I?
I'm Cauber Streck, a 16-year-old full-stack programming student, currently from Brazil.

I don't currently work, but I am open to any remote work opportunity, or in person if it is in Brazil in Santa Maria RS.

I not only study web development, but I have knowledge about hardware, game development and programming as a whole.
